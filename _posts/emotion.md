# _emotion_ üë©‚Äçüé§

<tt><em>&!\*¬¢^ you emotional, why you emotional</em></tt>


## NEED TO KNOW
*pick one way of doing things:* `styled` or `css`
1. how do i get started
2. how do i reuse styles
3. how do I style a new component
4. how do i add styles to an existing component
5. how do i theme / use variables / set base styles (global styles)
6. dark mode / localStorage of theme ‚Äì show this!! (remembers dark mode)


## a css primer

<dl><dd><strong>CSS</strong></dd><dd><em>Cascading Style-Sheets</em></dd></dl>

### the problem with CSS: ...

> why are you trying to change the paradigm, do you think you're some hot-shot who can just come in
> here and show off? why should we believe you

yes. the paradigm ~~has changed~~ is changing _all the time_.

remember this: at the end of the day, <em>it's all objects</em>. css isn't going away

```css
.class {
  cssproperty: cssValue;
}
```

```js
const jsx = {
  key: value,
}
```

#### naming conventions

notes from Kathrin Holzmann (<em>CSS in JS - beware the Hype</em> @CSSConf via JSConf 2019)

- if you can't name it, you don't need it

#### paint (first paint, in particular)

1. download html
2. download css
3. render css

css is "render blocking" the **Time To First Paint**. users HATE waiting, so we as devs should crush
it with our fist (borat)

> srsly? css files are small and http2 (starts html and css at the same time) and tcp connections
> and internet

`normalize.min.css` + `bootstrap.min.css` + `jquery.min.css` + `cool-google-font.css` + ... +
`index.css` = O(`MB`)? (<small>yes this is big-O notation, nerds</small>)

##### prioritize!

show users what they _need to see now_ (not a blank page), paint (i.e. style) later

##### purge css ‚Äì use only what we need

why are we loading CSS for pages / elements / stuff the user hasn't seen and doesn't know exists

#### questions: what if i really like...

##### CSS processors: postCSS, stylus, etc. it's over

stylus may've been hot stuff in 2017 but we survived, javascript is what's on now: we got options:

- plain ass css
- jss
- styled-components
- css-in-js
- "csx" emotion

##### CSS Modules

- not messing with webpack, babel configs
  - ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø ... write plain css
- css modules

well what if instead of `CoolComponent.module.css`

```
src/
  components/
    - CoolComponent.js
    - CoolComponent.module.css
```

pros:

- ability to scope styles (not everything global in `index.css`)
- no naming collisions (thanks to some CSS loader)
  - why we see things like `class='navbar__hsjd5bp'`

cons:

- requires webpack configuration
- no class <em>composition</em>
  - as react devs, we <em>love</em> (`<em>LOVE</em>`) composition
- not that hot anymore
- still writing LOTS of css

```
src/
  components/
    - CoolComponent.js
    - CoolComponentStyles.js
```

pretty much the same thing, right?

```css
.header {
  width: 100%;
  /* blah blah */
}
.header .header__nav {
  /* */
}
/* ... */
.header .header__logo .header__logo__img .header__logo__img__background {
  content: 'total nightmare';
}
```

not dynamic, incredibly verbose, **always global**

...but we all know why we don't write css

##### the thing we use already

quick points:

- css scope
- ***

### why css-in-js is amazing

```js
const Title = styled.h1`
  color: nikevolt;
  font-size: 2.4rem;
`
// ...
return <Title>This is weird</Title>
```

renders

```html
<h1 class="em-483osds">This is weird</h1>
```

#### props

> but we already have css variables (e.g. `var(...)`) and stylus makes it even easier!
> (`$link-color = 'blue'`) mixins! functions! `@import` / `@require`,

<strong>let's style a button</strong> requirements:

- a 'primary' button (e.g. `submit`, `save`, `login`)
- a 'secondary' button (e.g. `close`, `open`, `cancel`)
- a 'disabled' button
- `hover`, `focus`, `active`, `selected` states <strong>for each</strong>

<strong>with stylus (best case scenario):</strong> so we need to write a `class`

considerations:

1. where does this show up? nav? form? just anywhere?
2. what do i call it?
   - `.btn`? `.btn-nav`? `.nav-button`? `.nav-button-primary`? BEM?
     - Block Element Modifier
       - was invented by russians... (lemme finish) ... by _yandex_
3. nesting is cool, i should probably nest it
   - but what if i want to use it elsewhere?

```css
.button
  color $black
  background $white
  &.primary
    background $black
  &.secondary
    background $white
    color $black
  &:hover
    border 2px solid $black
    // dammit, hover states are different for primary and secondary and default
  &:focused
    // good luck
```

```js
const Card = styled.div`
  background: ${props => (props.darkMode ? '#111' : '#fff')};
  font-size: 2.4rem;
  .img {
    // can still next classNames, cool!
    object-fit: cover;
  }
`
// ...
return <Title>This is weird</Title>
```

renders

```html
<h1 class="em-483osds">This is weird</h1>
```

#### media queries

#### functions

#### nesting

### performance

### ssr

#### valid q: what if we need global css?

_see example_

### craco (a.k.a. 'crapo', ha ha ha) & babel setup

adjust craco.config b/c we need to adjust babel config
