<h2>About Nike <small>This is a short description of Nike and how the Customer Experience team serves the business capabilities.</small></h2>

Nike is a global sports company focusing on athletic footwear and apparel with over 1000 stores in more than 170 countries and increasing online presence.

With the onset of COVID-19, Nike has seen a tremendous increase in online service usage. Nike has since increasingly adopted analytic and machine learning technologies to enhance its business capabilities.

Nike adopted a "Composable Platform" strategy of building data platforms that
can be assembled like Duplo blocks.

Each platform needs a User Interface (UI) that helps business users access the
capabilities.
